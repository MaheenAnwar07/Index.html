                <p>We hired Care & Company to help our elderly uncle continue to live in his own apartment following a sudden onset of significant short-term memory loss.  Although he was in reasonably good physical health, he had become unable to properly care for himself due to the cognitive impairment.  Neither of us lives in Victoria, and there were no other relatives nearby who could attend to his daily needs.</p>
                <p>The Care & Company office team have been consistently helpful and professional in response to our telephone and e-mail enquiries and requests, and welcoming of our personal visits to the office including, on a couple of occasions, with our uncle. The caregivers who come regularly for a couple of hours a day (and more as required) to our uncle’s home are friendly, competent and caring.  They do grocery shopping and meal preparation, house cleaning and laundry, medication administration, take our uncle to appointments, and oversee his personal care.  In addition, and as important, they provide real companionship through playful conversation, discussion of current events and our uncle’s personal history, sharing of puzzles and books, and drives and walks around Victoria.</p>
                <p>We feel very grateful to have found Care & Company at a point when we were unsure of how best to help our uncle when we do not live close to him.  It is reassuring to know he is in such good hands, receiving the care, and company, he needs to maintain a good quality of life. We are pleased to offer this testimonial on behalf of the Care & Company team.</p>

            <p>My grandmother lived in Victoria and while she unfortunately had a stroke that confined her to a wheelchair or bed for the last 102nd year of her life, she was very sentient.  However, the immobility posed a problem as she required more care not just in terms of nursing but companionship.</p>
            <p>Fortunately, my sister found Care & Company Ltd. Each of the care aides I spoke to and/or met were not only professional, but are real people caring for real needs. The care aides brought peace of mind for my grandmother and the whole family.  The assistance was anything and everything from taking her for a stroll in her wheelchair to getting her tea to reading her stories or looking up the news or just providing company by having someone to speak to each day.  My grandmother repeatedly expressed her appreciation for the care aides. I highly recommend Care & Company Ltd.  The care aides are reliable and trustworthy.  But more importantly, I personally found the care aides to be real people with a genuine heartfelt care for others. Thank you to all who helped care for my grandmother.</p>

            <P>Caring for my Alzheimer’s-stricken wife has been the saddest and toughest experience in my life. The kindness, patience and positive energy shown by everyone I have dealt with at Care & Co has been a godsend. Thank you.</P>

            <p>Pandemic pressure. on top of accumulated serious structural weaknesses have put our federal/provincial health system under critical stress.,</p>
            <p>marked notably  by lack of access to quality family physicians for a large majority of BC residents.
                In these conditions access to quality home care is vastly reassuring, and so I am very pleased to be able to recommend Care & Co.Ltd. for their very
                professional top-level home care delivered by dedicated, competent and personable care givers.</p>
                <P>And I do this from the perspective of a  CEO who taught MBA students for 10 years after retiring in 2020, and so very much appreciates the C of C’s</P>
                <p>programmes to ensure and encourage public recognition of outstanding performance in all business fields.</p>
                <p>Top level professional competence requires a proper blending of “horizontal” communications,motivational and emotional skills, with mastery of the “vertical”</p>
                <p>technical and professional skills required to succeed in one’s chosen field of endeavour.  The  Care & Co caregivers, who are carefully recruited and assigned</p>
                <p>to individual clients, clearly demonstrate these skill sets as well as the  personal dedication required for outstanding performance in health delivery fields.</p>
                <br><p>They are effectively supported by a management team which has assembled a whole range of professional skills and services from which caregivers can select
                    those best adapted to individual client needs.</p>

            <p>I am so grateful for the caregivers at Care & Company. They have changed my father’s life in so many ways. I am continually impressed by their professionalism, dedication, and level of care. And they cook up some excellent meals, too!</p>

            <p>I can’t thank Care and Company enough for their support, professionalism and kindness. The staff working with my elderly father helped us quickly find a way to support him in just the right way that both he and my mother needed. Thank you for everything. We are grateful.</p>
